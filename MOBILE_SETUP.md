## Key Features Configured

âœ… **Custom Dialogs**: No more browser prompts, all UI follows app theme

## Hot Reload for Development

The Capacitor configuration includes hot reload support, so changes made in Lovable will automatically reflect in your mobile app during development.

## Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Update the server URL in `capacitor.config.ts` to your production domain
2. Build the app: `npm run build`
3. Sync changes: `npx cap sync`
4. Generate signed APK/AAB for Android or submit to App Store for iOS

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Clean and rebuild: `npm run build && npx cap sync`
3. For Android: Ensure Android Studio and SDK are properly configured
4. For iOS: Ensure Xcode command line tools are installed
